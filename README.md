# photographerWebsite
This website is a project made for fun by me. This website should be good for any photographer.
The project will be updated, this is just the first version.

 Website is responsive and includes:
•	Home, Contact and Porfolio page
• Admin Login page
• Admin Portfolio page
• Admin Message page
• Admin Add new picture page
• Admin Edit page (for now it only can delete one record from database when it's clicked on link named Delete)
